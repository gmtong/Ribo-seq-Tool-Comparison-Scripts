Gregory Tong (4/23/24)

**Introduction**\
A list of scripts for formatting and comparing small open reading frame (smORF) prediction pipelines (RibORF0.1, RiboCode, RiboTish, ORFQuant, and RibORF1.0). To recreate the analysis, you must have the output files after running each of the ORF prediction tools and to run the following scripts in python3.

**RibORF0.1 Analysis**\
For producing smORF lists using RibORF0.1, details of the step by step command line code can be found [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102649] and [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-019-0425-0]
